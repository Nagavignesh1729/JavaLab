Note, need to implement almost everything in recursion or other ways to learn recursive type of thinking.

ASSIGNMENT 4

Course Name: CS6308 Java Programming
Course Instructor: Jayachitra V P
Date: 4/09/2024
Exercise 1: Practice string methods
Write a java program to perform string methods by considering the given string inputs
String s1=”Welcome to Java”;
String s2=s1;
String s3=new String(“Welcome to Java”);
String s4=s1.intern();

Exercise 2: String reverse
Write a java program to read the string and displays the reverse of the string.
Hint: swap first character with last character until half of the string length
Exercise 3: Letter occurence
Write a java program to count the number of occurrence of the each letter in the given string using
single array
Hint: int index = 'b' - 'a'; // indicates index 1
int index = 'c' - 'a'; // indicates index 2
countChar[index]++;
 s1 = = s2
 s2 = = s3
 s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)
 s2.equals(s3)
 s1.compareTo(s2)
 s2.compareTo(s3)
 s1.equals(s2)
 s2 == s4
 s1 + s2
 s1.charAt(0)
 s1.indexOf('j')
 s1.indexOf("to")
 s1.lastIndexOf('a')
 s1.lastIndexOf("o", 15)
 s1.codePointCount(0, s1.length())
 s1.length()

 s1.substring( 3)
 s1.substring(1, 3)
 s1.startsWith("Wel")
 s1.endsWith("Java")
 s1.toLowerCase()
 s1.toUpperCase()
 “ Hi”.trim()
 s1.replace('o', 'O')
 s1.replaceAll("o", "O")
 s1.replaceFirst("o", "O")
 s1.split("O")
 s1.split("O", 4)
 s1.toCharArray()
 s1.codePointAt(0)
 s1.contains("or")
 String.join("-", s1, s2, s3)

Exercise 4: string extraction
Write a java program that extracts all numbers from a given string and returns them as a new string.
For example, "a1b2c3" should return "123"
Excercise 5: Compression
Write a Java program that performs string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
Example string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".
If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, return the original
string.
Exercise 6: Anagram
Write a java program to check the given string is Anagram or not
Example1 : Listen vs Silent
Example 2 : The Morse Code vs Here Come Dots
Exercise 7: Comparison of product version number
Write a java program that read a two string of the given format and compares the string
Example:
15.10.10 is greater than 14.20.50 as 15 >14
14.12.10 is greater than 14.10.55 as 12>10
14.10.15 is greater than 14.10.11 as 15>11
Hint: GivenString.split(“\\.”). Store each split part in an array and compare
Exercise 8: Email validity
Write a java program to compare the email is valid is invalid and retruns the username and domain
name
i) Valid Username: numbers[0-9], alphabets[a-z][A-Z], underscore, hypen and plus characters .
Total number of characters are 25.
ii) Presence of single @ symbol
iii) Presence of domain name .com, .in, .edu
Exercise 9: Dictionary
Write a java program to create a dictionary using 2D string array any 10 programming languages.
Write a method that return the definition for the input of PL name.
